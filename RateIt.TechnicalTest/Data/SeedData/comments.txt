It was a great experience
Thanks for all the help!
I appreciate all the help I got from the staff.
I'd love to see more men's t shirts
Really happy with the service, special thanks to Jenny
Great range, keep it up
Beautiful store & staff
Wow, the the staff really went out of their way to help me, thanks Tim!
Service was great
Quick and easy, service was great
I love everything here :)
It was ok
The store could be cleaner
The prices should be a bit easier to read. The tag colours are hard to distiguish
All good, but you did run out of the basics (no M sized plain black Tshirts)
How can I get future discounts?
Would be great to see more accessories (belts)
You didn't have the product I wanted!
The staff was VERY rude to me. Never shopping here again :(
The wait was too long
No stock left of what I was after (new summer Ts in S)
Why can't you offer a refund, I only bought it yesterday!!
Perhaps your staff should pay attention to customers coming in instead of talking amoungst themselves and playing with their phones"
